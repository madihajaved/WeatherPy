# WeatherPy Analysis
## Overview
This analysis focuses on using user input in form of weather temperature to shortlist cities on a map which would be ideal as vacation destinations. From the list of potential travel destinations, four cities are chosen to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map are created.

## Results 
The current iteration takes the input from user and runs the code for the minimum and maximum temperature selected. Based on this, cities from a random list of global cities are short listed. 

WeatherPy_vacation map shows the shortlisted cities as markers on map. 

Based on these cties, four were selected in Europe to create a road trip itinerary. Those were shown on the map with a driving route and a marker layer with key information was created and saved as an output map.
